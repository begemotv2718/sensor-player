Play wav file on touching capacitive sensor (completely software specified).

WARNING: the project is not working properly yet!
Mostly working parts: playing wav file from uart command line, command line sensor calibration. 

This work is greatly influenced by "Discovering the STM32 Microcontroller" book by Geoffrey Brown.


Initially cloned from template stm32 project by h0rr0rrdrag0n.
Below is the description of this template project.
Template STM32VLDiscovery project for Linux. No Keil! No IAR! No any another IDE's such as Eclipse!
Only blank black console, emacs or vim for source code editing, ARM port of GCC for compiling, GDB 
with stlink for load program to flash with using ST-Link on STM32VLDiscovery board (bb stm32flash! :-) ),
Makefile and make utility to operate with project files and given utilities.
